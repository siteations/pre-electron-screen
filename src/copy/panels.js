Thanks to its thriving Jewish community, Spain was the leading center of Hebrew scholarship since the Middle Ages. Everyone agreed that the highest quality Hebrew manuscripts were produced there, so Cisneros was well-positiond to acquire the best proof texts on which to base the Complutensian’s Hebrew edition, and the conversos recruited to produce it – Pablo Coronel, Alfonso de Toledo, and Alfonso de Zamora – all had extensive experience working with these manuscript sources. Even the later polyglots turned to Spanish manuscripts to produce their versions. The manuscript displayed above is the Newberry’s oldest Hebrew manuscript, a fragment of the Book of Chronicles that was made in Spain at some point in the 11th century.',

By the 16th century, scholars agreed that it was a very problematic text, filled with questionable translations and 1,000 years of inherited scribal errors that scholars were eager to fix. The Roman Church, however, considereed the Vulgate the definitive translation, and forbade anyone from making a corrected edition. As a result, the Complutensian scholars built their edition of the Vulgate from medieval manuscripts in Spain, none of which were complete. The Vulgate shown here a complete version of a 13th-century manuscript of the Vulgate from France.',

Manuscripts of it – such as this example from the Newberry’s collections – were widely used in Jewish synagogues throughout Europe to explain and interpret the Hebrew text. The Targum was both a translation and an explanation, incorporating commentary from generations of rabbis and even some Talmudic fables along with the text. This made it somewhat difficult to use as a source for a definitive text of the Bible, and the Complutensian only included the Targum for the first volume of the Bible (which contained the Pentateuch). Later polyglots would include the entire Targum, after more editorial work had been done.',

Interest in learning and using Greek in religious studies grew throughout the 14th and 15th centuries, especially after the fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. Thereafter, Biblical material in Greek began to appear in print, beginning with the psalter pictured here. Inspired by this, Cisneros borrowed Septuagint manuscrips from the Vatican to produce the first printed edition of the entire Septuagint Old Testament in his polyglot.',

The Complutensian scholars refused to leave out these original languages, but placed the Vulgate in the very center of the page, with the Hebrew and Greek alongside. They described it as a representation of the Crucifixion, with Christ flanked by thieves on either side. As the image shows, the Plantin polyglot takes the same visual approach in order to appease the Catholic church. Due to its Protestant origin, the London Polyglot did not bother with this, giving more prominence to the other original languages.',

Understanding Hebrew depended on understanding its root words, the building blocks on which all Hebrew vocabulary (and thus all of Scripture) were built.

More importantly for polyglot creators, the first translation of the New Testament was into Syriac, in a version known as the Peshitta. Scholars and printers throughout Europe were eager to bring this early translation into print, and acquired manuscripts to make the necessary typefaces.

The friendlier relations allowed for more Greek and Near Eastern manuscripts to come to Europe. One of the more successful of these agents was Ogier Ghislan de Busbecq, the Holy Roman Empire’s ambassador to the Ottoman Empire in the 1550s and 1560s. An avid humanist himself, Busbecq always set time and money aside to purchase manuscripts – especially Greek ones – to bring back with him to Europe.

The introduction of Syriac reflected the general scholarly interest in printing the key texts of Christianity in as many languages as possible. The book shown here, for instance, gave readers 50 different versions of the Lord’s Prayer in various languages and dialects.

						narrative: 'Christians in Europe assumed that Near Eastern Christians were backward, misguided, and ignorant of Christian doctrine. In part, the polyglots were made to help Europeans learn the languages needed to minister to their wayward brethren. Syriac was one of these, but, like many Near Eastern languages, hardly anyone in Europe was familiar with it. To get around that problem, polyglot scholars used more familiar languages to help readers access unfamiliar ones. For the Antwerp polyglot, Plantin’s collaborators decided to transliterate the Peshitta into Hebrew, so scholars could begin to grasp how the Syriac alphabet worked. They could then use the accompanying Latin paraphrases to translate it. In so doing, Plantin’s team followed the same approach taken by Johann Widmanstetter, the first European to print the Peshitta in 1555. That edition was accompanied by this short text, which used Hebrew and Latin to help scholars master the Syriac alphabet.',

In particular, the typefaces designed to print unfamiliar languages often enjoyed long careers printing works of history, linguistics, and ethnography. The typefaces used to print the Syriac text in the Antwerp polyglot were passed down to Plantin’s son-in-law, Frans Raphelengius, who used them to print a revised edition of the French scholar Joseph Scaliger’s De emendatione temporum. This book, which charts out human history using ancient calendar systems, shared the same intellectual spirit as the polyglots, as it placed the histories of Near Eastern peoples (Jews, Babylonians, Persians, Egyptians, etc.) alongside that of the Greeks and Romans.

One of the most significant challenges printers faced was ensuring that all the languages printed on a single page showed exactly the same amount of text. With its nine languages, the London polyglot was especially daunting in this regard. In the passage shown here, for instance, the printers were responsible for matching up 11 different translations and paraphrases of just over two psalms. ',

As such, the creators of the great polyglots expected people to use them to learn about God. Indeed, polyglots were considered the most definitive editions of biblical texts available that would reveal the spiritual meaning of the Word in its deepest sense. Since using them was no easy task, however, scholars also developed materials to help readers get as much spiritual value out of the polyglots as possible. The text shown here, a collection of commentaries on all the books of the Bible, is an example of one of these aids. This projected was spearheaded by John Pearson, one of the early advocates for the London polyglot, and was perhaps intended to supplement Walton’s great work.

Their creators often used the material that did not make it into the polyglots for other projects. In particular, the work of learning to read, write, and speak the Near Eastern languages in the polyglots contributed greatly to the development of what was then called Oriental studies. Thanks to Walton’s project, England became the leader in this field by the middle of the 17th century, with scholars producing a number of historical, literary, and philological works centered on Near Eastern cultures. An early byproduct of this activity was the Lexicon heptaglotton, a dictionary of all seven Near Eastern languages used in the polyglot compiled by Edmund Castell, who had corrected the Samaritan, Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic editions in the London polyglot.

For instance, one of Walton’s primary goals for his polyglot was to prepare missionaries to correct troubling religious practices and beliefs among Near Eastern Christians. This short work, published two years before the polyglot was finished, was intended to help achieve this goal. It taught readers how to read, write, and pronounce the Near Eastern languages that would appear in the polyglot. With this background, the London polyglot became a kind of textbook that missionaries and scholars could use to communicate with Eastern Christians in their native tongues.',

In time, this became one of the major motivating factors in polyglot scholarship; the London polyglot was rooted in the flowering of Arabic studies at the universities in Oxford and Cambridge in the 1620s. In this way, the London polyglot scholars carried on the project of the Medici Press in Rome, which was founded in 1584 to print material in Arabic for European as well as Ottoman audiences. Some of these materials included guidebooks for learning how to read, write, and translate Arabic, which were enthusiastically used by European scholars. The Newberry copy of this workbook shows this clearly; an early owner added additional Arabic works, including some copied out by hand.',
